            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>The Regiment being ordered to march to <hi>New-ca≈øtle,</hi> when they came at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> had the paper called <hi>the ca≈øe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ≈øtated</hi> read unto them; upon which they re≈øolved unanimou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to march, ≈øaying, it was contrary to their Ingagement, to be devided, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, according to the Orders I had received, I cau≈øed the Drums to beat, &amp;c. but few or none would come to their Collours, but they flocked about me, and told me, they were re≈øolved not to march, whereupon I u≈øed all the Arguments of per≈øwa≈øion that I could, as many witne≈ø≈øes can te≈øtifie, &amp;c: But it would not availe, they generally and unanimou≈øly ≈øeized upon the Collours, and ≈øet them in the Waggons, and ≈øet a ≈øtrong guard upon them, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>At a Councell of <hi>Warr</hi> held at <hi>Hockley,</hi> I gave my Vote for their marching, it pre≈øenting it ≈øelf, rea≈øonable to me al≈øo, &amp;c. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Councell of <hi>Warr,</hi> and told them I had received Orders to march, and the rea≈øons thereof, and gave as many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as I could to per≈øwade them, but they combined and con≈øulted together what to do, murmuring among them≈øelves, &amp;c
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165162:4"/>
and that night they came furiou≈øly into my Quarter, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Colours of me, but I denyed them my Colours, telling them that it was mo≈øt rea≈øonable, the Colours ≈øhould remain in my Cu≈øtody, &amp;c: But they told me, they could not believe any of their Officers; nay, that they could not believe their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c. So they went into the Chamber, and fetched the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and ≈øet a ≈øtrong guard over them at the Waggons, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And when I came to <hi>Olney, &amp;c.</hi> they all determined not to march further; yet the next morning I commanded the Drums to beat, intending to march according to my Orders, &amp;c. but the Companies came together, and unanimou≈øly re≈øolved not to march, though I propounded unto them all the Arguments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and rea≈øon that I could; profe≈øsing, that though I was a friend, and ever would be, God willing, to all ju≈øt de≈øires, re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and mutuall ingagements, yet I was an enemy to irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. Whereupon they were ≈øu≈øpitious of me, that I was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to ju≈øtice, and the liberty and freedome of the people.</p>
                        <p>Not long after, the ≈øame day, came more Colours from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton≈øhire,</hi> which made them more and more exorable; and by my pre≈øsing, I received an affront by a Cavalier, &amp;c. who ≈øwore by the Name of God, they mu≈øt not believe any of their Officers, and that they mu≈øt fight again≈øt <hi>Independents, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon I fearing a de≈øigne de≈øtructive to the Army, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Kingdome, I told them the ca≈øe of the Army ≈øtated, came from ≈øuch hands who were re≈øolved enemies to ≈øuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, &amp;c. ≈øo that I was bound in judgement and con≈øcience to the Nation, and to the Generals ju≈øt authority, to continue with them in this di≈øtemper, to keep off that unju≈øt de≈øigne which I feare per≈øons did endeavour to carry on, whom God hath in ≈øome mea≈øure di≈øcovered, and will more in due time, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon they marched back, according to their own deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, to <hi>Dun≈øtable,</hi> many of the Hor≈øe al≈øo having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them full of di≈øtempers, &amp;c. and there they received a Letter, the ≈øub≈øtance whereof was, that they ≈øhould ≈øtand (as I remember) to their hone≈øt ingagements for Souldiers rights, and <hi>Englands freedoms;</hi> and the party that brought the Letter to them, told them, the Generall, and Lieutenant Generall would

not oppo≈øe them, though they were not ≈øatisfied in the way yet: and the≈øe expre≈øsions made the Souldiers more and more exorable.</p>
                        <p>After that, the Lieutenant Colonell and Major came to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtable,</hi> and brought another Order from the Generall, and read it to them, but could not prevaile, &amp;c. But the Officers vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ≈øome of the Captaines, with my ≈øelfe, ≈øhould goe through their Quarters with Orders for them to march into <hi>Buckingham≈øhire.</hi> But when we came to <hi>Luton,</hi> we heard the Souldiers had a Randevouz off and from them≈øelves.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øaid Officers went to Captain <hi>Talhur≈øts</hi> quarter, and found a Guard ≈øet on him and his money, by his own men, and there the ≈øaid Captaines wounded or killed one or two men, and one Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant was al≈øo wounded.</p>
                        <p>So I parted from the Captaines (after we had procured a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion) and told them, I would go to the Randevouz though I lo≈øt my own life, (as it was probable enough as they confe≈øt) and give them my Orders received of the Major; and accordingly I came to <hi>Dun≈øtable,</hi> and read my Orders to my owne men in the Town, the Randevouz being broken up, and gave them all the Arguments that was in me to march; but they told me their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall determination at the Randevouz was, that they would march to <hi>Readborne</hi> to a Randevouz; and ≈øo they did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without my con≈øent or approbation, &amp;c. as many witne≈ø≈øes can te≈øtifie: and that night before they went to St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> they ≈øet a Guard upon me and my Colours, &amp;c. and ≈øo they marched to <hi>S.

                        <p>I receiving a Letter from the Generall upon our march, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding me and the Souldiers to ≈øtay where that Letter ≈øhould come to us. I told the Me≈ø≈øenger, I did not continue with them as commanding them, but to hinder an unju≈øt influence, or the enemies de≈øigne upon them, and to keep as much as I could, the Generals authority among them, which I was and am tender of. And I communicated my Orders to the Souldiers, and they all cryed out, they could not goe to that Randevouz, and that they were betraid, if they did. Whereupon the Souldiers petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Generall, who ≈øent me a particular Order to march to <hi>Ware Randevouz.</hi>

            <p>That at a Court of Warre held at <hi>Richmond,</hi> after the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall had ordered the Regiment to march to <hi>Newca≈øtle,</hi> he ≈øaid that it was not fit for the Regiment to march thither, but to ≈øtay neere <hi>London,</hi> untill the Parliament had confirmed the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øals of the Army, and the freedome of the people.</p>
            <p>And that when the Regiment did march, the Colonels Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany mutinying at St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> Captaine <hi>Bray</hi> did ≈øay that it were better for the Regiment to march back, then to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that if the Colonels Company would march back, he would march in the head of them.</p>
            <p>And when the Company did return back in a mutiny, he did march back in the head of them, and i≈ø≈øued out Warrants under his own hand to the Countrey, to bring in Hor≈øes to draw the Waggons back, when they ≈øhould have marched forward.</p>
            <p>And the ≈øaid Captaine <hi>Bray</hi> in the height of the mutiny at <hi>Dun≈øtable,</hi> did ≈øpeake to this purpo≈øe, That the Parliament were our profe≈øt enemies, and that there was no vi≈øible Authority in the Kingdome but the Generall; and that the Generall was not infallible: His Lieutenant Colonell de≈øiring to know of him, whether he would goe to the head of his Company, and acquaint them, what orders he had received from the Generall, he an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I ≈øhall not: and gave it as his opinion, That the way to get the Regiment to march, was to ≈øend a faire letter to the Agents of the five Regiments of Hor≈øe, and to get an Order from them.</p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding the≈øe things, with much more of the ≈øame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was proved again≈øt him, yet he pretending he ≈øtayed with them, only to prevent the influence of others upon them, as in his foregoing Narrative, the Court Martiall was willing to take the be≈øt ≈øen≈øe of him they could, &amp; did not proceed again≈øt him upon

this charge, which they would hardly have done, if they had been ≈øo much inclined to arbitrary tyranny, as him≈øelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have endeavoured to repre≈øent them.</p>
            <p>For if the circum≈øtances of this mutiny be impartially con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what a di≈øtemper it wrought in the whole Army, nece≈øsita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a generall Randevouz to ≈øatisfie the Souldiers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What opportunities it gave to evill minded men to put both Army and Kingdome into a flame. Nay, how indu≈øtrious and active the Cavaliers agents were on the one hand, and our di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented friends on the other (who have alwayes pretended better things then their de≈øperate &amp; bloody endeavours at that time, and often ≈øince doe demon≈øtrate they intend) there is not any man that ever knew in the lea≈øt mea≈øure, what belonged to the government and di≈øcipline of an Army, or of any other well governed Society, but will rather wonder, that every tenth man of them did not ≈øuffer, then think ≈øuch a ≈øtorm could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed with the executing of one man, though they ≈øhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand no more of the Story, then what hath been related by Captain <hi>Bray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who in his Narrative takes no notice of their in≈øolent barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous carriage towards their Officers and the Countrey, which was ≈øo horribly wicked and barbarous, that all the Felons which have ≈øuffered at <hi>Tyburn</hi> the≈øe twelve moneths, are not really guilty of ≈øo many horrid outrages, as they were in that time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Countrey and their Officers, the particulars thereof are too tedious to relate. Not any of their Officers except Captaine <hi>Bray,</hi> the Quarter-ma≈øter, and one more, as I remember, dur≈øt come neare them, ≈øome of them being pur≈øued many miles by their owne Souldiers, who ≈øwore as they pur≈øued them, they would be revenged on them, and did violently take away di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Hor≈øes in the Countrey in this pur≈øuit of their Officers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Officers were run away with their money, when they were forced to run to ≈øave their lives, there being one Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant dangerou≈øly wounded by them. And at that time when this man, <hi>viz. Arnoll,</hi> was executed, there were divers other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers could not be heard of, and the re≈øt did feare, that they were murthered and made away by their Souldiers.</p>
            <p>And they did not exerci≈øe their rage and cruelty towards ≈øuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165162:6"/>
in the Countrey, as were enemies to the cau≈øe, they were rai≈øed for, and paid to maintain, but on the contrary where ever they came in their march, inquired if there were any Round-heads in that Towne, and again≈øt them did they exerci≈øe their cruelty. Some hone≈øt men at St. <hi>Albanes, &amp;c.</hi> informed me, that they were never ≈øo u≈øed by the Cavaliers as they u≈øed them, and did affirme, that if Captain <hi>Bray</hi> and the Quarter-ma≈øter had not been with them, who had a little influence upon them, they had been certainly plundred, if not murthered; many of whom have been, and ≈øtill are, as faithfull to the intere≈øt of the people, as the highe≈øt clamourer again≈øt this piece of nece≈øsitated ju≈øtice.</p>
            <p>In this in≈øolent di≈øtemper did they march to the Randevouz, where they were drawn up by their Captaine Lieutenant <hi>Bray,</hi> and there ≈øtood with white papers in their Hats, as if they had been going to ingage with an enemy. When the Generall had viewed the re≈øt of the Army, he came to them, attended with his Officers, who commanded them to pull their papers out of their Hats, but they refu≈øed. Whereupon ≈øome Officers rode in among them, and plucked out the papers of ≈øome that were mo≈øt in≈øolent, and then the re≈øt began to ≈øubmit.</p>
            <p>By this time ≈øome of their own ≈øcattered Officers were gotten up to the Randevouz, of whom the Generall and Officers enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who among them had been the principall Leaders and actors in this mutiny, and commanded them as they could e≈øpy them, to ≈øingle them out, and accordingly they drew out as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, eight or nine. A Court-martiall being called in the place, they were all found notoriou≈øly guilty of particular facts in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and were there adjudged by the Lawes and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of warre to dye; and accordingly ≈øentence of death was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon them, and afterward referred to a Lot, all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned but one, on whom the Lot ≈øhould fall, which was this <hi>Arnoll,</hi> who was pre≈øently ≈øhot to death in the place. And I well remember ≈øome of the Officers of that Regiment, did much rejoyce in the ju≈øt hand of God, directing the Lot upon that man, whom they had ob≈øerved to be more notoriou≈øly guilty then any other in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. <hi>The Lot is ca≈øt into the lap, but the whole dispo≈øing thereof i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

for their procedings with, is <hi>William Thom≈øon,</hi> a Corporal in Captain <hi>Pichforts</hi> Troop, in Colonell <hi>Whaleys</hi> Regiment, who was que≈øtioned at a Court-martiall in the Regiment, for <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenne≈ø≈øe, gaming,</hi> and <hi>quarrelling,</hi> The ≈øtory followeth: The ≈øaid <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> being at a Tavern in <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> after ≈øome time ≈øpent in drinking &amp; carou≈øing, he fell into play for money; finding him≈øelf in danger to lo≈øe, he began to quarrell with the man he played with, who perceiving his de≈øigne, took the ≈øtakes into his hand: Upon which Mr. <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> laid violent hands upon the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tore him by the haire, and by force po≈ø≈øe≈øt him≈øelfe of the ≈øtakes. In the mean while the Gentlewoman of the Hou≈øe being putting her husband to bed, hearing a great noi≈øe of quarrelling below, came running down among them, and endeavoured to part them: upon which <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> threw her down, kickt her on the face, and mo≈øt gro≈øly beat and abu≈øed the ≈øervants for ≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to part them. And he being not able to have his will on them him≈øelfe, goeth away, and not long after returned againe with ≈øome other of his companions, and in the dead time of the night forced into the hou≈øe with his drawne ≈øword, wounded three or foure of the ≈øervants, laid felony to the charge of the Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe of the Hou≈øe, and two others, for robbing him of 20. <abbr>l.</abbr> of gold and ≈øilver, tooke one man away pri≈øoner, <hi>viz. William Mou≈øe,</hi> threatning him to tye him neck and heels together, if he would not confe≈ø≈øe his money; notwith≈øtanding by his owne confe≈øsion afterwards he lo≈øt none. All which is te≈øtified at large again≈øt him by Mr. <hi>Miles</hi> of <hi>Colebrook</hi> and his wife, <hi>Thomas Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and <hi>George Weare,</hi> and mo≈øt of it confe≈øt by him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>Upon debate of the premi≈øes, he was adjudged by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of warre, to be ca≈øhiered at the head of the Regiment the next Randevouz: which ≈øentence he would not ≈øubmit unto, but endeavoured to get the Souldiers of the Regiment to ≈øtand by him in this quarrell: from which irregular mutinous carriages proceeded that which followeth.</p>
            <p>Upon the 28. <hi>of October,</hi> the Regiment had a Randevouz up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Odiam Heath</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the ≈øaid <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> ≈øtill abiding with the Regiment, notwith≈øtanding hee was ca≈øhiered ≈øix weekes before, and had received ≈øeverall orders to depart the Quarters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:165162:7"/>The Major of the Regiment did there endevour according to the judgement of the Court, actually to ca≈øhiere him at the head of the Regiment, which he in a peremptory mutinous manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to ≈øubmit unto. Upon which there was a new charge exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited again≈øt him, con≈øi≈øting of ≈øeverall Articles, the heads where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are as followeth.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, that the ≈øaid <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> at or about the tenth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1647. did a≈ø≈øume the title of a Souldier in the Army, under the command of his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and came to the Regiment of Colonell <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> being at a Randevouz, and there ≈øpake to and in the hearing of all the Souldiers, ≈øeverall ≈øeditious and mutinous words, and delivered ≈øeverall ≈øeditious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ≈øome written, others printed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he endeavoured to make mutiny in the ≈øaid Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by pretending he had brought a letter from the Agents of 15. Regiments, and ≈øaid he came to the Souldiers, and not to the Officers, affirming there were accu≈øations again≈øt the Officers of the Army, labouring thereby to make a divi≈øion betweene the Officers and the Souldiers, pre≈øsing the Souldiers to ≈øub≈øcribe his papers. All which were proved upon oath by Captain <hi>Griffith Loyd,</hi> Captain <hi>Gilmond Taylor,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> Trooper, all in Col <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Regiment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that upon the 20. of <hi>October</hi> he endeavoured to make a mutiny in Colonell <hi>Whallies Regiment,</hi> as followeth, The ≈øaid <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> being adjudged by a Court-Martiall to be ca≈øhiered at the head of the Regiment, Major <hi>Swallow,</hi> the Major of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, required him to di≈ømount at the head of the Reigment; but the ≈øaid <hi>Thom≈øon</hi> refu≈øed, charging the Regiments Councell of inju≈øtice, and appealed to the Souldiers of the Regiment for ju≈øtice, pretending it was again≈øt their ingagement, to ≈øuffer any Souldier to bee ca≈øhiered without ≈øatisfaction, with many more words to this purpo≈øe.

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:165162:7"/>Fourthly, the ≈øaid <hi>Thom≈øon,</hi> after he was ca≈øhiered and di≈øcharged the Regiment by his Major and Captain, did ≈øtill continue in the Quarters of the ≈øaid Troop for above the ≈øpace of ten dayes. In all which time hee was not inrolled in any Troop, or Company: All which is proved again≈øt him by Capt. <hi>Floyd,</hi> Capt. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Capt. <hi>Pich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Benjamin Yates,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> which brings him within the eleventh Article of Duties in the Camp and Garri≈øon.</p>

               <hi>No man that carrieth Arms, and pretends to be a Souldier, ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main three dayes in the Army, and not be inrolled in ≈øome Company, upon pain of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This charge being thus proved again≈øt him, he was apprehended &amp; brought pri≈øoner to <hi>Win≈øor;</hi> from whence contrary to his ingagement to the Matiall generall, he made his e≈øcape, and was afterward again apprehended at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> and ≈øent pri≈øoner to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged guilty of his charge by a Court-Martiall, &amp; had the ≈øentence of death pronounced again≈øt him according to Law. After which the Generall inclined to mercy towards him, and reprieved him from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent execution, but continued him in pri≈øon. But the Army being marched from <hi>London,</hi> and he left at <hi>White-Hall</hi> in the charge of a Martials man, did there make his e≈øcape the ≈øecond time. Since which time he gathered together a company of men in Armes, whom hee quartered upon the Countrey, calling them his Troop, and they him Captain; with whom hee marched to a Gentlemans hou≈øe in <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> who had a ≈øuit depending in Law with another about a Title in land, whom he by force &amp; violence di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øt, taking his Tenants and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants pri≈øoners, driving them before him in miery way in the night, pricking them on with his ≈øwords point in a mo≈øt barbarous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell manner. For which he was brought pri≈øoner to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> ≈øent by the Court-Martiall to the civill Magi≈øtrate, who tooke Bayle for his appearance at the A≈øsizes. He no ≈øooner had his liberty, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cau≈øe or provocation, ≈øtabd one Mr. <hi>Hayden</hi> with a Dagger, of which wounds he is ≈øince dead. And within a few dayes after, he was again taken on the Road, with a party of other men, whom he had deluded into his evill cour≈øes; and had found about him a great black Periwig, and a fal≈øe Beard, which they brought back againe with him to <hi>White Hall.</hi> From whence he was ≈øent in ≈øafe cu≈øtody a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the civill Magi≈øtrate, bailed by Lieut.

And what his actions &amp; end hath been ≈øince, is ≈øo notorious, I ≈øhall not trouble you with the relation of it here. <hi>The righteou≈ønes of the perfect ≈øhall direct his way, but the wicked ≈øhall fall by his owne wickednes,</hi> Pro. 11.5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:165162:8"/>The third per≈øon of this number that hath been proceeded again≈øt for mutiny, and for whom ≈øo many are offended, is <hi>Robert Lockyer,</hi> a man unknown to me untill the time of his impri≈øonment: ≈øince which time I have inquired of him, and have heard a very ill report from the mouthes of ≈øuch, who ≈øpake it with no delight, and yet had cau≈øe and opportunity to inquire into, and ob≈øerve his demeanour: but there being a relation of the proceedings of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe again≈øt him, with the cau≈øe thereof, already printed, I ≈øhall not trouble you with any thing of that again; only I mu≈øt ob≈øerve to you his un≈øtable demeanor in the time of his ≈øuffrings, while he was before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the witne≈ø≈øes giving their te≈øtimonies again≈øt him <hi>viva voce,</hi> he could not deny any thing of that which was laid to his charge, but did endeavour to evade it, with ≈øuch criticall cro≈ø≈øe interrogatories to the witne≈ø≈øes, as di≈øcovered more of wit and ≈øubtilty, then of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe or integrity in him.</p>
            <p>The next morning after he was ≈øentenced, he ≈øeemed to be very ≈øen≈øible of his mi≈øcarriage, and ≈øorry for his fault, and did de≈øire dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, what ≈øhould be the be≈øt way for him to make his mind known to the Generall, &amp;c. And there being then a Petition drawn, which the other five that were to ca≈øt lots, had ≈øub≈øcribed, he de≈øired to ≈øet his hand to it, and joyn with them in it; he was advi≈øed to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what he did, and was told, that it was not a time to di≈ø≈øemble neither with God nor Man, and that the words of the petition which he de≈øired to ≈øub≈øcribe, and his former di≈øcour≈øe, did not agree. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, having heard the petition read ≈øeverall times to him, he ≈øet his hand to it, in which he hath the≈øe expre≈øsions, <hi>That the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall would be plea≈øed, out of his wonted clemency and goodne≈ø≈øe, to pa≈ø≈øe by that unwi≈øe and unlawful action of theirs, and give them their lives for a prey; and we do vow and prote≈øt before the Almighty God, that we are heartily ≈øorry for our faults, and doe promi≈øe, as in his all-≈øeeing eye, never to doe the like action again, nor ≈øuffer it to be done, if we can hinder it with our lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then within a few houres after, there being a warrant ≈øigned for his execution, he changed his mind again, as if he had not been the ≈øame man, and began to ≈øpeak evill of his Judges, and the Law by which he was judged, &amp;c. and to ju≈øtifie him≈øelf as an innocent ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in a good cau≈øe, &amp;c. and ≈øo continued untill he died.</p>
            <p>Now that which I ≈øhould de≈øire the Reader to ob≈øerve in this brief narrative of the≈øe three mens faults and puni≈øhments, is this: Fir≈øt, what ground there is for the≈øe great clamours again≈øt the Army, for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165162:8"/>
murther, and barbarous illegall proceeding? &amp;c. Have they not all had faire and legall trials, by that authority, which they voluntarily placed them≈øelves under, and ≈øubmitted to, and that with ≈øo much le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and tenderne≈ø≈øe, as the mo≈øt able of tho≈øe, who have taken Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans work out of his hand, <hi>to be the accu≈øers of their brethren,</hi> are not able to produce one pre≈øident of the like. Had the ≈øame faults been committed by ≈øuch numbers, tending to ≈øuch an apparant hazard of publick ruine in any Army, that ever was in Chri≈øtendome before this, the ≈øuffering of every tenth man would hardly have excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed them; and yet here was but one man of one thou≈øand in the fir≈øt, and one out of three or four≈øcore in the la≈øt; and the other, though notoriou≈øly guilty, yet ≈øpared: and yet here mu≈øt be murther and barbaroune≈ø≈øe and tyranny, laid to the charge of tho≈øe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired nothing le≈ø≈øe then their deaths, if they could have an≈øwered their duty to God and Man, in ≈øparing them their lives. <hi>Then ≈øtood up Phineas and executed judgement, and ≈øo the plague was ≈øtayed, and that was accounted unto him for righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe unto all generations,</hi> P≈øalm 106.30.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond thing I de≈øire may be minded in the narration is, what ground the great pretenders of <hi>Englands liberties</hi> can have to think, their good cau≈øe is either, intere≈øted in, or prejudiced by, the puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the≈øe evill actions, unle≈ø≈øe that which was puni≈øhed in the≈øe men, be the liberty they ≈øo much contend for, which mu≈øt needs be a liberty in particulars to the prejudice of the generall.</p>
            <p>And for Mr. <hi>Lockyer,</hi> whom they are plea≈øed to canonize a Martyr ≈øince his death, there is le≈ø≈øe to be ≈øaid for him upon that con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then for either of the other two: for he and tho≈øe which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined with him, did not ≈øo much as pretend common right and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor had the lea≈øt colour of any one grievance lay upon them, except their not having their pay before it was either received by their Officers for them, or due unto them, which is a new grievance never heard on before in an Army. And this is acknowledged by the Author of the ≈øecond book intituled, <hi>The Armies Martyr,</hi> page 6. as followeth, <hi>Many per≈øons that formerly knew him, came to vi≈øit him, much lamenting his ≈øad condition, being condemned for nothing, but for asking his pay, and indeed that was the thing which mo≈øt troubled him, that ≈øo ≈ømall a thing as contending for his pay, ≈øhould give his enemies occa≈øion to take away his life, which as he often ≈øaid, had it been for the fredome and liberties of this Nation, it would have added much to his comfort, &amp;c. For he knew it was malice that prevailed over him, not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165162:9"/>
ju≈øtice.</hi> I cannot pa≈ø≈øe by the≈øe words, without ob≈øerving ≈øomething from them: His friends lamentation over him is, that he ≈øhould be condemned for nothing but asking his pay, and his own words are, <hi>For contending for his pay.</hi> But it was for neither of the≈øe that hee ≈øuffered, for they are neither of them faults.</p>
            <p>A Souldier may lawfully ask his pay of his Officer, and if he deny it, contend with him for it; nay, if he can prove his Officer have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded him, or unju≈øtly detained from him one dayes pay, he may have him puni≈øhed for it, and that with the lo≈ø≈øe of his place, by an expre≈ø≈øe Article of warre. And I challenge any Souldier of the whole Army, or other, to produce one in≈øtance, that ever they appealed to the Generall, or Court-Martiall, again≈øt any Officer, and had not a ≈øpeedy and legall tryall: and if it were u≈øefull in this place, I could in≈øtance in many hundreds of ca≈øes, where the Souldier hath been righted again≈øt the Officer, and ≈øuch extraordinary reparations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as no Court in <hi>England</hi> would doe between man and man. Nay, in many ca≈øes where the Souldier hath cau≈øle≈øly and wrongfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecuted his Officer at a Court-Martiall, and yet hath not had the lea≈øt reproof from the Court, ≈øo tender have they been of di≈øcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Souldiers in this particular. But if a Souldier ≈øhall demand his pay of his Officer before it be due, or when it is due, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory mutinous way, it is puni≈øhable according to the manner and mea≈øure of the fact. For it is po≈øsible, a Souldier may demand his pay in a peremptory in≈øolent way of his Officer, and yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve much puni≈øhment: As for in≈øtance, ten, or twenty, or more, may goe together to their Officer, and demand their pay of him, if it be due; and admit they will not be ≈øatisfied with a rea≈øonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, but ≈øhall there give him provoking, reviling, nay threatning language, no man will ≈øay this is commendable, but blameable, if not puni≈øhable; and on the other hand, if no wor≈øe con≈øequence attend it, then that Officer and his Souldiers falling out, no man will ≈øay, this de≈øerves death. Nay further, if Souldiers ≈øhall demand their pay of their Officers upon a march, or at a Randevouz, or ju≈øt when they are commanded upon ≈øervice, in the manner afore≈øaid, which is wor≈øe then the other, yet if they do not refu≈øe to march, or doe their duty when commanded, though it come within the Article of warre, it is the more excu≈øable.</p>
            <p>But the ca≈øe of Mr. <hi>Lockyer</hi> and the re≈øt of his a≈ø≈øociates, are much different from all the≈øe ca≈øes: For fir≈øt, they had no pay due, they having been better paid ≈øince they came la≈øt into <hi>London,</hi> then ever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165162:9"/>
they were ≈øince a Troop, being them≈øelves before hand with the re≈øt of the regiment, &amp; the regiment aforehand with mo≈øt of the Army.</p>
            <p>And further, they did not only demand their pay in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid before it was due unto them, but refu≈øed to march, di≈øobeyed the commands of their Officers, while they unju≈øtly quarrell for their wages before they had earned it, they refu≈øe to do their work, for which they were paid<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and did not onely di≈øobey their Officers commands, but re≈øi≈øt them in the doing of their duty, forcibly ≈øeize upon the Colours, detain them from their Officers when demanded; and this not done in a ≈øudden hurly-burly, or an heat of blood, but with deliberation, continuing in this po≈øture neere two dayes and nights, gathered them≈øelves together into a ≈øtrong hou≈øe, and there kept it again≈øt their Officers. When their Colonell and Officers came in love and pitie towards them, per≈øwading them by rea≈øon to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with them≈øelves, what ≈øad events mu≈øt follow, if they nece≈øsita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to u≈øe extremity; putting them in mind, how comfortably they had ventured their lives together again≈øt the common enemy, promi≈øing them all they either did or could de≈øire, if they would be ruled, and march after the Regiment. But all this would not prevail, Mr. <hi>Lockyer</hi> with ≈øome other of their Leaders, furni≈øhed them with arguments to trample upon, and in≈øult over clemency. For when their Officers, (I mean their Colonell and Major, and 2 or 3 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Regiment) had granted them all that they could think to ask, they then told them in plain <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> they had been too long fed with words, they had tru≈øted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øo often, that they would tru≈øt them no more. And all the while they thus capitulated with their Officers, they ≈øtood drawn up in Galleries and Windows with their Swords and Pi≈øtols, as if they had been treating with an enemy, and did not ≈øubmit, untill the yard was a clearing, to make way for the Hor≈øe and Foot to force them.</p>
            <p>The≈øe things con≈øidered, with the circum≈øtances of time and place, if the Lord had not wonderfully prevented it, by awing the hearts of a di≈øcontented popular multitude, it might have proved as bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a day to that great Citie, and more fatall to the Kingdomes intere≈øt, then ever yet <hi>England</hi> ≈øaw, or thought of.</p>
            <p>The next thing ob≈øerved out of tho≈øe words quoted of his, is this, <hi>Which as he often ≈øaid, had it been for the freedome and liberty of this Nation, it would have added much to his comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly I cannot blame him, <hi>If ye ≈øuffer for righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe ≈øake, happy are you, but let none of you ≈øuffer as an evill doer, or a bu≈øie body, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:165162:10"/>I hope there was not a man that had a hand in puni≈øhing him for his mi≈øcarriage, but would rather have ≈øuffered with him in ≈øo good a cau≈øe; but it is cleare out of his own mouth, his con≈øcience told him, he did not ≈øuffer for tho≈øe things: and if not, how come the great pretenders for <hi>Englands</hi> liberties and freedome, to glory ≈øo much in his ≈øuffering? Is it an honour for a man to ≈øuffer as an evill doer, becau≈øe he is a good man, or rather the more ≈øhame? <hi>He that knowes the fathers will, and doth it not, ≈øhall be beaten with many ≈øtripes.</hi> The more able and rationally principled the man was to promote good things, the more he was to be pitied and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, but the le≈ø≈øe to be gloried in.</p>
            <p>But this kind of ≈øpirit at the latter end of the fir≈øt warre, raged in our froward di≈øcontented brethren of the Presbytery, they having a jealou≈øie, though without cau≈øe, that the ruling part of the Army di≈øcountenanced men of their judgement and principles meerly for being ≈øuch, they pre≈øently began to be very inqui≈øitive into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies proceedings again≈øt offenders. After which the Army could not proceed again≈øt any Officer for the vile≈øt offence, that could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were it plundering the Countrey, cheating the State, or his Souldiers, drunkenne≈ø≈øe, ≈øwearing, &amp;c. or for being countenancers of ≈øuch per≈øons, or things, but pre≈øently they were ≈øaid to be per≈øecuting Presbyterians: and ≈øo now, let Souldiers commit never ≈øo great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as <hi>Arnoll</hi> afore≈øaid, and afterward ≈øtick a paper in his hat with this motto, <hi>Souldiers rights, and Englands freedom</hi> writ upon it, and that mu≈øt be like a Popes Bull to pardon all their faults.</p>
            <p>And ≈øo for <hi>Thom≈øon,</hi> let him drink, and game, and quarrell, to the ≈øcandall of the Army, beat, fright, wound the countrey people, hale them out of their own hou≈øes captives, like dogs through the dirt in the night, for no other fault but endeavouring to keep the peace of their own hou≈øes. And after all this, pretend to common right and freedome, and then all proceedings again≈øt him mu≈øt be barbarous and tyrannical, &amp;c. Remember, <hi>He that ju≈øtifieth the wicked, and he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>demneth the ju≈øt, are both an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Pro. 17.15</p>
            <p>The third thing I mu≈øt needs take notice of in his own words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted, is this, <hi>For he knew it was malice that prevailed again≈øt him, and not ju≈øtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How little ground him≈øelfe or any other had to think ≈øo, was not hid from them≈øelves, and I de≈øire it may be known unto others.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, as I apprehended, the man was a ≈øtranger to all his Judges, not one before that time had ever ≈øeen him, ≈øo as to remember him,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:165162:10"/>
if ever they had heard of him: for I ob≈øerved it every time his name was taken notice of in the evidence, the whole Court de≈øired to ≈øee which was that man, at lea≈øt 3 or 4 times over, though he ≈øtood in their ≈øight all the time; and all the Officers of the ≈øaid Regiment, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the highe≈øt to the lowe≈øt, were de≈øired to withdraw at the time of the debate, and came no more there. So in who≈øe heart that malice ≈øhould re≈øt that overcame him, is left to bee judged. But as it fared with <hi>Cain</hi> after he had murthered his brother, <hi>he thought every man that met him would murther him;</hi> ≈øo doth it with malicious evill-minded men, they think every man that oppo≈øeth them in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, beare hatred and malice towards them; whereas I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Lord beares witnes to the con≈øciences of this mans Judges, that if by ≈øparing his life, they ≈øhould have hazarded the ruine of none but them≈øelves, they would have cho≈øe to have done it with joy, rather then have executed him. <hi>But the integrity of the upright ≈øhall guide them, when the perver≈ønes of tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors ≈øhall de≈øtroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But grant you, the fact was never ≈øo foul, and the offenders ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo guilty of it, yet the way of your proceedings again≈øt them, is illegall, you trying them by Martiall law in the time of peace, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Truly, for <hi>Magna Charta</hi> &amp; the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> I never read more of them, then what I have ≈øeen printed by L. Col. <hi>Lilburn, &amp;c.</hi> in their papers, in which I have ob≈øerved a great deal of oppo≈øition to Martial Law in times of peace, as in C. <hi>Brayes, Thom≈øons</hi> &amp; <hi>Lockyers</hi> ca≈øe, yet I could never find it any way made good, that tho≈øe things which were charged again≈øt <hi>Strafford,</hi> &amp; others in that point, were for their proceedings again≈øt Souldiers under their immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and conduct, and for ≈øuch actions as their being ≈øouldiers, made them more capable of committing, then in another capacity could have been. If ≈øo, I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe, I could never clear it up to my owne judgement, that tho≈øe lawes in that particular, doe provide for the peoples weale, but for their woe: tho≈øe lawes in that ca≈øe, do neither provide for Souldiers rights, nor <hi>Englands</hi> freedome. As for in≈øtance, Would the Souldiers account it their right, to be liable to actions at the Common law for every triviall offence, which oftentimes their imployments, as Souldiers, doth nece≈ø≈øarily put them upon towards countrey-men, would their ≈ømall pay inable them to attend the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious trials at law, oftentimes far di≈øtant from their quarters and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, in chargeable Courts, where they are nece≈øsitated to plead by coun≈øell? Or would they be willing to be liable to indictments at the Size and Se≈øsions, and there injoyned attendance for every ≈øu≈øpition
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:165162:11"/>
a country-man could have again≈øt him. For to be ≈øure, if there were any mi≈øchiefe done by a man in a red coat, with a ≈øword by his ≈øide, the next Souldier the hue and cry overtook in that habit, mu≈øt needs be ≈øu≈øpected, &amp; there to be triable by twelve of the neighbourhood, where the offence is committed, though him≈øelf be never ≈øo much a ≈øtranger in tho≈øe parts. And all the knowledget, the Jury could have of him, would be, that he was a Souldier, which would hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him more favour then is allowed to vagrants in ≈øuch ca≈øes.</p>
            <p>Again, would the countrey-man account it his liberty to be liable to the injuries and violence of Souldiers, and have no other remedy again≈øt them then the common Law? What Baily, or Officer, would undertake the ≈øerving of a Writ on a Souldier in an Army, for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fee? And in ca≈øe ≈øome would, and the Souldiers ≈øhould re≈øi≈øt, and protect one another, and in a mutinous manner beat or abu≈øe the Officer, the plaintiffe hath no remedy ≈øtill, but the common Law. For it would be arbitrary tyranny in an Officer to exerci≈øe any power over the Souldier in times of peace, ≈øo much as to rebuke or puni≈øh him for neglect or di≈øobedience: and what an Officer would ≈øignifie in an Army, or an Army in Kingdome thus di≈øciplined and governed, I de≈øire the prudent to con≈øider; and what a multitude of ≈øuch inconveniences, attended with many un≈øupportable evils and burthens, both to the Souldier and Countrey, may be enumerated, I leave to your con≈øideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be granted, that there is a nece≈øsity of Martial Law in an Army, yet why ≈øhould it be ≈øo arbitrary and ≈øharp? why are not pui≈øhments more proportionable to offences?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I could heartily with this objection might be an≈øwered by amending &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting what is ami≈ø≈øe in that kind, which hath often been de≈øired and propounded to be done by the ruling part of the Army; only want of opportunity hath preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, yet <hi>I</hi> mu≈øt ≈øay this in an≈øwer unto it, That if any Souldier in the Army, or other can produce one pre≈øident, where the letter, or rigor of the Article hath been made u≈øe of again≈øt one man, when the equitable ≈øen≈øe and ju≈øt &amp; favourable≈øt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Article hath not been included in the fact, there will be ≈øome ground for this objection to be made a pre≈øent g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
